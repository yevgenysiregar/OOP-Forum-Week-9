<p>

1. (A)  A class is a type of blueprint that you can use to make objects. A concrete 'thing' that you constructed using a certain class is an object, which is an instance of a class. So, while the terms 'object' and 'instance' are interchangeable, the term 'instance' refers to an object's relationship to its class. Using the example of the questions, as said before, class is the blueprint, then we can say that the class are for example the template for the details of the sales personnel. On the other side, the instance are the details for each sales personnel such as his/her name, age, gender, salary, etc.

    (B) With the aspect provided in the questions, one way for it is to have some sub-classes that are the kind products that the company manages, extending the parent class with let's say the name "Product". Another way of it is to have a parent class with let's say "Employee" or "Worker" with a sub-classes that inherits the parents that contains managers, office staff and sales personnel.

   (C) The uses of libraries can make people who want to create the program so much easier and more efficient as people don't need to create the code from scratch.


2.  (A) The solution for this question is on the GitHub.

    (B) The accessor methods are necessary as it is to keep the SalesPerson class private and can't be changed outside of the class.

    (C) (i)

    (ii) If there's an input error, no way to fix it.

    (D)

    The output is:
    
    102

    2

    2550.4

    5000.0

    (E) The solution for this question is on the GitHub.

    (F) The solution for this question is on the GitHub.

    (G) The solution for this question is on the GitHub.

    (H) Add a list to store for example last month's sales and current month's sales so we can compare the sales between last and current month.

    (I) No inheritance, with it, no override. Overloading on 2 constructors on the SalesPerson class.
